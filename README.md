# RSpecOscalFormatter

This Library provides an RSpec Formatter that helps you to define tests that align with OSCAL Catalogs and SSPs, and produce Assessment Plan and Assessment Result documents based on the test results.

## Installation

Note that this library currently depends on a (temporary) fork of oscal-ruby that includes the artifacts we are interested. We hope to coordinate with that team to merge the codebase and move on to other projects.

TODO: Replace `UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_GEM_NAME_IMMEDIATELY_AFTER_RELEASE_TO_RUBYGEMS_ORG` with your gem name right after releasing it to RubyGems.org. Please do not do it earlier due to security reasons. Alternatively, replace this section with instructions to install your gem from git if you don't plan to release to RubyGems.org.

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_GEM_NAME_IMMEDIATELY_AFTER_RELEASE_TO_RUBYGEMS_ORG

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_GEM_NAME_IMMEDIATELY_AFTER_RELEASE_TO_RUBYGEMS_ORG

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

PLEASE SEE A [DEMO SPEC HERE](https://github.com/Credentive-Sec/rspec_oscal_formatter/blob/main/spec/demo_specs/demo_spec.rb) THAT GIVES AN OVERVIEW OF THE METADATA REQUIRED TO MAKE THIS WORK.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
